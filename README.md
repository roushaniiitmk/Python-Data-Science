The overall goal of this project is to help to focus on areas that will foster economic development for their respective states. Since the most common measure of economic development is the GDP, we will analyse the GDP of the various states of India and suggest ways to improve it. Since different states are in different phases of development, the recommendations should be specific to the states.
The data for this analysis is downloaded from data.gov.
